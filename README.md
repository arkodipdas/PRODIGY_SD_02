# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple Java Swing application that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and continues until the user guesses the number correctly. It then displays the number of attempts taken to win the game.

## Features

- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Prompts the user to input their guess.
- Provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
- Displays the number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly.
- Resets the game automatically after a correct guess.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
